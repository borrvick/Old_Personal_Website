                    <h2>Nice to meet you.</h2>
                    <p>
                        My name is Ben. In May of 2020, I graduated from Clarion University and had high ambitions of starting my professional career 
                        in the techworld. Unfortunately after many months of preparation and coming off the tail end of my senior capstone project,
                         COVID hit, leaving myself and many others in a pickle. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Initially I was extremely concerned. Especially after creating plans for the past 4 years just to be halted by the pandemic. It
                         did not take long for me to see the “set back” as one of the greatest opportunities that I have ever been given...time! I took 
                         a step back from coding to focus on learning things that I have never or not been able to give my time to. I began reading and 
                         learning about music marketing, social media advertisements, running social media pages, photography, videography, editing, content 
                         creation, music production, audio engineering, financial literacy, and much more!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Over the past year or so I have had the privilege to work on myself in ways I could have never imagined. As my bucket list has gotten 
                        smaller and smaller, I have found myself ready to cross off another item and pursue my professional career. In fact, this website is 
                        part of my journey back. I wanted to create something simple, yet functional to be somewhat of a “headquarters” for my progress. 
                    </p>

                        Thank you for being a part of my journey and I'm excited to see what the future has in store.
